# Mapping_Earthquakes
We would like to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic plates’ location on the earth, all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and the data on a third map. This map visualizes the data geographically, making the UI user experience friendly.
